## Week In Review

I spent most of this week being sick. I picked up a bad case of food poisoning on NYE which weakened my immune system and then I picked up the flu or something else. Sunday was the first day in a week that I felt like a semi-normal human being. It took everything I had to get through the week but at least it ended on a few bright spots like getting to watch a KU game at Allen Fieldhouse and going to The Sandbar Christmas party.
