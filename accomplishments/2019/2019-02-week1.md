## Week In Review

Hoping to close on a place soon because we have to get out of the place that we are in. We were skunked three times this week along with some critter problems that we are facing. We just want out and to be in a house that does not smell like skunk, dead possum, or any of the other issues that we keep running into. This has pretty much consumed our lives for the last few months and we just want out.
