## Week In Review

This week I gave 30-day notice on where I'm renting this week. It's complicated and frustrating, but after four months it's time to move on. Our goal is to buy or find a new rental if that falls through.

We also survived the Polar Vortex this week, but it was chilly. Temperatures ranged as low as -3 F with a wind chill below -21 F. 

My son was also sick three days this week, so it was a juggle. I finished the weekend watching KU play basketball and watching the Super Bowl the next day at a friend's house. We almost made it through the first quarter before it was Oliver's bedtime and he was ready to go home to crash out.
