## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

I had a wonderful week filled with kick-starting lots of DjangoCon initiatives. I worked on a pretty interesting internal project at work and I had time to re-factor my Trolley project (still very WIP).

@adamfast added me to his Concord email filtering Django project a while back and this week I made getting my setup to be more manageable a factor. I re-factored the app to add support for groups and a few other features which commonly junk up my inbox. I'm happy with the results even if I'm only 1/2 through it. I can run the script and not hate opening my inbox now. Mission accomplished!
