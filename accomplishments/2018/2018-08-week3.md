## Week In Review

I restarted my weekly goals this week after another hiatus. It's been a while which seems to be the theme of my most recent updates. Lately, my time has been split between family, work, djangocon, psf, defna, and a few side projects that I have been planning. The side projects are giving me motivation/energy to push forward on a few ideas that I have been wanting to itch for a while. More on that soon, but I have been updating my progress on [wip.chat](https://wip.chat/@jefftriplett)
