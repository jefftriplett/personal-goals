## Week In Review

I went to Kansas City to watch First Aid Kit perform. They have been one of my favorite bans since slightly before Oliver was born. Since his birth, they have been my goto for getting him to fall asleep. [Emmylou](https://open.spotify.com/track/7exdcu9SmgcrZ7hW9ZdcYo?si=9gzA5PN3RWSwLEUGD1cY6A) is our song. 

I celebrated my first Father's Day with my son and my family. They rented a cabin near the lake, and we spent the weekend driving back and forth. It was a great weekend. The first day was a bit too much for him, but we took my son swimming twice, and he loved it on the second day.
