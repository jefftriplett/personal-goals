## Week In Review

This week we celebrated Christmas, we drove back from Chicago, and I celebrated another successful trip around the sun. This time of year has a lot of feelings and meanings for me because it combines the holidays with a birthday and a new year. It's kind of a great time to reflect on life, happiness, goals, and where I see myself by this time next year.
