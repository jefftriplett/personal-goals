## Week In Review

Finished off my last work week of 2018 and drove with my family to Chicago to hang out with my in-laws. My son did about as well as could be expected for a 15-month-old who just had to ride for 8.5 hours in a car.

I spent some of my downtime this weekend moving my various bots and automations into one repo to be open sourced. Everything is isolated using docker and will eventually be on Github once I have all of the settings updated and scrubbed.
