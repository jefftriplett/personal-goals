## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

My week was going great until we had an ice storm, a snowstorm, and my car broke down after dropping Oliver off at Day Care. I got to be a stay-at-home daddy one day and had to take my car in to get 3 foot of battery cable replaced, a new alternator, a new battery, and I had them fix an oil pan seal leak. 

I worked on a few blog posts and came up with some new goals for 2018. Still a partial work-in-progress, but I'll have it wrapped up soon enough.
