## Week In Review

This week I picked up my car and dropped some money on getting it fixed :money_with_wings:. I am happy to have a running vehicle again. I lived downtown for so long that I took having a car for granted. I walked everywhere and didn't turn my car on for almost two years. Since I have moved, I live just far enough away that getting my son to and from daycare an issue now when my car is sick.
