## Week In Review

This week I tried to catch back up at work. For the last few years, I have taken the last week of the year off. I think going forward; I am going to take the first week off of the year too. I put my time in and do my job, but mentally, it's a challenging week. 

I hit Thursday afternoon and realized that I was working harder to be productive than I would any other week of the year. 

Then I read this an [article](http://blog.rescuetime.com/225-million-hours-productivity/) which stated that on a good week, most people average 12.5 hours a week of productive work between email and all of the other distractions at our jobs. I don't think I'm nearly this low, but I am used to task switching a lot.

I thought I was having a good week, but then Friday through Sunday, I felt like my energy level dropped to 30%, and I was having weird migraines and vision issues. I am feeling better tonight, but I am still not quite back to 100%. 

I played a bunch of Zelda though and had some good family time with N, O, and P. 

I have also spent a lot of time reading about Lillian's [Life Stack](http://anomalily.net/life-stack/), [Expense Reports](http://anomalily.net/2017-expense-report/), and [Robots](http://anomalily.net/stickingtoresolutions/).
