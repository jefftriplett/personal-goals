## Week In Review

This week I mostly spent juggling clients, work projects, and life.

I attended SantaCon and had a blast. It was my first real day/night outing since Oliver's birth. It was great, and I had a lot of fun. 

I abused my health goals a bit this weekend by drinking too much and not eating enough. I tried to get back on track today, but since I met my health/weight goal, I'm still trying to figure out my comfort level with maintaining where I am at physically.
