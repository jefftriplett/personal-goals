## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

This week I spent most of it happy to be in Lawrence and home. I spent more of my time cleaning, unboxing, and generally doing boring things than I wanted but I also managed to get a second run in this week. 

I had a fun night out Friday at 715 which is one of my favorite restaurants. Saturday I met friends for a late lunch and then I helped keep record times for the Trail Hawks from 7 pm until 2:30 am. I left "early" but the race didn't get over until 6 am in the morning. 

I decided to give Keto a try so I spent quite a bit of the week studying up and trying to make a game plan. Since moving and summer hit, it's no longer quite as practical to walk to work. My bike has issues when I'm more than half a mile out, so I'm back to driving everywhere. Since I'm getting much less exercise in per week, I decided to force myself to run more and eat better. After hearing many friends praise Keto, I'm going to give it a chance. 

I also hurt one of my knees while moving so running is difficult, but I'm working through it. I bought a set of TheraBand Resistance Bands to help me work through it. 

My [Meh.com](https://meh.com/) streak increased to 271.
