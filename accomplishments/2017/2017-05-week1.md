## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

This week REVSYS turned 10 and I have been with the company six(ish) now. What a ride. We had a party at The Sandbar and then loaded up in a stretch hummer to head to Myers Hotel in Tonganoxie, Kansas. It was worth it.

A turned in the notice on my current house and am moving to a new place in North Lawrence in a month. So I spent my weekend celebrating, packing, cleaning, moving, and upgrading my bed to prepare for the move.
