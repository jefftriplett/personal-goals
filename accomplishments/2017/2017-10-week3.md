## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

Back at my personal goals list after falling off since :baby:. I have really fought to keep a work-life-me balance lately which I'm sure is normal with having a kid. I work all day, go home, and then I'm on baby duty until 1 am or 2 am to give Nicole a break which I love doing. Most nights I have half hour or hour breaks or long enough to get a run in. Other nights, it's a struggle to get Oliver to sleep for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time. 

So much of my not very much free time energy has been spent trying to optimize how I do things since I have less time but still need to accomplish things. It's hard, but getting easier by the week.
