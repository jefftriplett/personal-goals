## Week In Review

It was a pretty typical week for me filled with work, meetings, and working on community projects. 

I spent quite a bit of time lately working both on Django COC's and working on DjangoCon US. I have spent more brain cycles on the COC side and trying to help get it back to a healthy number of volunteers. I'm thankful to have recruited a few friends to help out which has helped my stress levels tremendously. 

The was cold and frigid and then we had three beautiful warm days in a row. This weekend I watched the KU game with friends, went to another friend's birthday at Gaslight Tavern, and then I stuck around with another friend to listen to music.
