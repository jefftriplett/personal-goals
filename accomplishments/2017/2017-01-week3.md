## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

This week can be summed up by one word: busy. Between clients, DjangoCon US prep, trying to get my outside commitments pruned down, and trying to carve out some "me" time I was busy all week. 

I missed my Monday night run so I made up by running ~2 miles on Friday over lunch and <4 miles on Sunday. I ate pretty reasonably healthy all week and I even made lunch and brought goulash to work all week.

My blog article was well received and I'm happy that I motivated a few people build a MagicMirror too! I wrote two plug-ins for it, but I still have a ways to go before it's production ready. 

I also did quite a bit of work on my blog this week. I added SSL and put it behind a CDN. I updated the open graph tags so that it's more social friendly. I even tried out AMP tags but I wasn't happy with the trade-offs involved. I hooked Google Analytics back up and all of that fun stuff. Progress.
