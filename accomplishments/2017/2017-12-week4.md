## Week In Review

This week we celebrated Christmas, my birthday, and celebrated New Year's Eve with friends playing board games. Oliver's daycare was closed all week, so it turned into a last minute staycation for me. I needed the time off, and I worked on various projects and played a ton of Zelda on my Nintendo Switch along with spending lots of time with my son for most of my break. I also watched a ton of Twitch streams.
