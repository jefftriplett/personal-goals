## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

This week we celebrated our REVSYS holiday party. It was great. Good people, food, drinks, and good times. We also took a few days to work on an internal work project together as a team. 

Saturday, we had a family hike at Clinton Lake with Lacey who is visiting from Oregon. Oliver did great and slept through the entire event.

I also watched two KU games this week. KU won a big away game but lost a home game which only happens every two or three years. I hope, but suspect, we might lose another home game this year. 

I took a keto break for a few days and was feeling it on Sunday. This re-confirmed my goals and my decision to use keto as a tool going forward. If you go from low / no carb to high carb, your body does funny things. Beware.
