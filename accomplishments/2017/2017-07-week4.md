## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

I decided to enter [Ludum Dare 39](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/) where I wrote my [first game which was based on Sokoban](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/ld39-sokoban). I had a blast and am planning on doing a blog writeup of some of my notes. 

This is short this week because it's the first time I have five day over since I started doing my weekly updates. Most of my time has been split between working on my game and getting ready for DjangoCon US in Spokane.

More soon.
