## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

I started a Keto diet which is more of a lifestyle change. Short terms effects are losing a quick 6 lbs in the first week. I'm sure my weekly updates will be more and more obsessed by this going forward. I spent a lot of free cycles reading up and learning about how to do Keto proper. I navigated a few parties successfully and I managed to drop weight which I consider a success. I also got a nice 2+ mile hill run in too in addition to my normal Monday night run.

I worked on my blog and converted my topics into a Jekyll collection which cleaned up a lot of things. I have continued drafting but not quite finishing some blog posts. This next week I'm going to catch up or that's my goal.
