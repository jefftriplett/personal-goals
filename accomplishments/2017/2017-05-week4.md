## Week In Review

This week I got back from PyCon US which was great. I spent the rest of the week packing because I move in a few days. On Memorial Day, I went to two friends parties/BBQs which was chill and even took a nap in a hammock. Packing wore me out though and I'm fighting off a headache so I'm call this week's review early.
