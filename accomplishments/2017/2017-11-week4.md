## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

It has been a little over two months since I updated my personal goals which are a shame. Between the new baby and forming new habits, I have traded updating GitHub for physical index cards. It works well too, but I miss having a record. 

Last week, I had a bit more free time than I expected with Oliver crashing out every night after daycare. 

I open-sourced two new projects, updated two recently open-sourced projects, and helped finish [revsys.com](https://www.revsys.com). 

I started a keto-based diet at the end of June 2017, and I am happy to say I reached my goal weight this week. All said and done; I lost 43 lbs. in five months on Keto, and I have never felt better. That's dropping from a size 40/42 down to a size 36 in men's pants. I dropped from an XL/XXL to an L in shirt size too. 

I decided to set a new goal -5 lbs under my original goal to make it easier to maintain, but I dropped another 2 to 3 pounds this week without really trying. 

My running slacked off for a few weeks, but this week I am determined to power through and get some miles in again.
