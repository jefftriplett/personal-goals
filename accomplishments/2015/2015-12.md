### Month In Review

This month was a trying but good month. I overstressed trying to context switch from one client to another at work. I had the flu possibly twice. I also ran into issues trying to get a conference finalized due to holiday schedules, vacations, and shifting events.

I spent the Christmas holiday with my family which was nice despite the three days of solid raining and the flooding which hit the area. 

I had a low-key birthday and New Years Eve which is what is exactly what I was feeling. I great start to 2016.
