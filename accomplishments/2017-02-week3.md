## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

This weekend family visited from Chicago. I had lots of time playing with my 20 month old niece. Good times and such a fun age.

I also battled getting my car's registration switched over from Kansas to Missouri. A few battles both won and lost over this. It's way more complicated than it should be. 

I read several articles on budgeting and personal finance management so that's where my brain continues to be. I don't have any universal advice, but I keep finding ways to cut expenses and I still have plenty of room to improve this.
