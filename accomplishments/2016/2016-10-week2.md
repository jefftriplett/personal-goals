## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

After two weeks of headaches, they finally went away. Even the thought of alcohol has made my head rage though. Saturday I took two sips of a port wine at a tasting and my headache came back. I'm totally fine not drinking, but I like having the option without having a headache when I'm near it. #firstworldproblems

I did lots of behind the scenes work on DjangoCon US for 2017. It'll be nice once this is done and I can talk about it.

It was also a super busy week working for my day job client. I look forward to the post election retrospective and getting to talk a little more about some of the performance tuning I have done. I started writing some checklists recently which I use and I have been debating bundling it up in some way. I think it's pretty useful since it's what clients pay me to do for them.
