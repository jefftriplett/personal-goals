## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

The Christmas break and seeing my family was great. I came back with a touch of something :mask: but after a long nap I'm feeling much better. 

I was also super busy with work last week. I had a few breakthroughs with a team I'm managing remotely (25% time CTO ftw) along with having a new appreciate for Docker and doing all the things with it.

I'm also over cold weather. Over. It. Dot. Gif.
