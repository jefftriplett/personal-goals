## Week In Review

I spent the week and Thanksgiving holiday in Chicago aka Naperville, IL. Lots of car time and extended family time. I'm getting much better at working remote than I used to. Since I have spent most of the last month and half doing so, I guess I'm getting good practice in.

DjangoCon US should be kicking off soon. I'm starting to be the blocker so this week is dedicated to fixing that and getting out of the way.
