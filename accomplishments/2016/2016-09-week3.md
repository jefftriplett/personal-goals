## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

My first intermediate Ukulele classes started this week. The pace was nice and it was great to learn a few new strumming techniques. This all feels new to me still, but it's nice to have something that I'm both awful at yet able to pick up fairly quickly. 

I had a quiet weekend after an extended happy hour Friday night. I needed some introvert time and I mostly followed through on that. I started and finished Longmire season 5 (too short) over the weekend, listened to hours of podcasts, ordered Indian take-out, cleaned the house, and in general just chilled while working through my overflowing Todoist list.
