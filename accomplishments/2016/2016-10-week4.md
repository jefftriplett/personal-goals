## Week In Review

This week I took a family trip to Myrtle Beach and then came home long enough to do laundry, re-pack, and then go back to the airport to fly to London and Amsterdam for two weeks. 

The beach was fun, but it was the off season which lead to non-ideal weather. The last two days were warm but we spent the last day in the ER with Nicole's mom who ended up catching pneumonia. So the week didn't end great but she's doing well.
