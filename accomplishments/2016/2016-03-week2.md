## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

It was a great week for basketball and getting DCUS stuff done. Kansas has been playing really well and walked through the last half of the season, Big-12 Tournament, and the first two rounds of the tournament. 

DCUS is starting to roll with most of our big announcements coming out this past week. From here it's just a matter of planning and connecting the dots. Completely overly simplified view of course, but it has a beat and we just have to follow it.
