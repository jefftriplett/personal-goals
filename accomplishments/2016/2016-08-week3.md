## Week In Review

Good week. I started off strong with a run on Monday and I started my second set of Ukulele lessons on Wednesday. Uke eats up one of my running days so I'll have to figure that out going forward.

After rebooting my credit or lack there of, I was happy to see that my credit score hit mid-700's which I consider a success after not having a credit card since college. Adulting is hard. I'm thankful for my friend John for giving me advice on how to build my credit from scratch.
