## Week In Review

My week was primarily spent in Amsterdam and London while working remote during the election. I had a wonderful time at [Django Under the Hood](https://www.djangounderthehood.com/). It was good to catch up with old and new friends. I forgot how much I missed getting to hangout with so many wonderful people.

The rest of the week was a mixed bundle of feelings because of the election and seeing friends, family, and everyone's reaction outside of the US.

When I left London parts of it started to feel like home albeit busier than I'd like. I definitely get the appeal of the city and the food choices are wonderful.
