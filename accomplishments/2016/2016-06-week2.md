## Week In Review

My week mostly centered around DCUS (too many things to list), Ukulele lessons, and my trip to Chicago to celebrate my niece's 1st birthday party. Turns out practicing Ukulele has been a great stress release outlet. 

I also want to start running again, but I haven't been able to mentally pull it off and get back into the habit. Same goes with my lost attempts at starting a Kettlebell workout. Both of these might have to be part of my post-DjangoCon goals.
