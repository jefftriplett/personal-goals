## Week In Review

Another good week. I'm enjoying Blue Apron a lot. It's amazing how stressful planning dinner for a week is for me. Now I have a routine and I get to learn more about food than I would have if I just grabbed random things at the grocery store and tried to make something. I'm now cooking with foods that I commonly buy, yet I never would have thought to cook in that way. 

I have also learned more about portioning too. Now I know what I can make with a smaller portion and it's fine. This is much less stressful than 

Things are going better on the conference front. Coordinating a venue search was more more involved and harder than I thought even when we asked the community to do the leg work. Turns out this was easier said than done. I'm starting to see it come together though and I hope to have this rolling soon.
