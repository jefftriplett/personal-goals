## Week In Review

This week I flew to Houston to meet a client and to kick off a new project. I got to catch up with Kojo over dinner at a diner. 

When I got home, I had a touch of sickness before learning that my car was going to get towed since I haven't moved / driven it in over six weeks because I was gone. The rest of my week went pretty much was a blurry mess of me adulting. This weekend, I had dinner with some friends, played with Docker, watched a KU :basketball: game, hung out with friends, went to the :dog: park, and was a coach potato at home (still hit my step goals though).

I'm ready for 2016 to end and for 2017 to begin.
