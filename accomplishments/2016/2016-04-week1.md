## Week In Review

Other than being sick all week (and still sick), it was a pretty good week. I missed all of my health and I didn't get to start running again but that's unavoidable when fighting allergies or the crud.

This week I need to get caught up on day-job and we are hitting our DCUS stride with tickets, proposals, financial aid applications, and now sponsorships rolling in.
