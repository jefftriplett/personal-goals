## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

It took me a few weeks to assemble every thing I needed to mount my :bike: rack, but I finally did. :tada: I had to buy a metal file and do some surgery after replacing the rack with one that would work with my disc brakes.

For my day job client, I helped them scale up for the election and it marked the first time the website which gets 10s of millions of hits held up to a tremendous amount of traffic. I have scaled up some large systems, but this is easily the largest gain in the smallest amount of time for the most overall traffic.

I also had a series of headaches and decided to quit drinking for a while. The two are unrelated but there are some health goals that I want to hit and it was the easiest path since I'm starting to plateau in my weekly progress.
