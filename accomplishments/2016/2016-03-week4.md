## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

Every April for the last three years, I met up with friends at the [Kanopolis State Park](http://ksoutdoors.com/State-Parks/Locations/Kanopolis) for the [Rockin K Trail Run](http://www.ksultrarunners.org/rkinfo.html). This year was no different and it's a great opportunity to see friends whom I only see once a year. I have never ran the course, but it's on my list do attempt at some point. It's both a heavy marathon (one loop) and a 50-miler and I'm told it's quite a challenge.
