## Week In Review

This week I re-started running. My goal was to finish one or two runs in the hot and overly humid Kansas summer. I settled for one but I ran 90% of a 1.2 mile hill run which was not easy but I did so with just a short walk break and still clear a 13 to 15 minute 1.2 mile run. I'll take it.

This was a good week to get caught up on work including client work and writing a few blog posts for my day job. Not a bad week but I need to still manage my time-boxing a little better.

I have admittedly been slacking on my personal goals and most things in life over the last few months leading up to DCUS. This week I tried to just chill out and play catch up when possible.
