## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

It was a busy week which flew by. I spent the three day weekend back in SWMO with my family and catching up. We topped the weekend with a nice Sunday night cookout with family. We also drove to the lake to look at my sister and her fiance's sailboat and so my sister could pickup a tandem bike at a flea market which she found a few weeks ago. It was a great weekend, but now I'm ready for a day off to recover from my long weekend.

I also picked up some bike lights, panier's, and a rack system so that I don't have to carry my backpack with me. Once everything is in, I have to figure out how to attach it all to my bike which might be harder than I first thought.
