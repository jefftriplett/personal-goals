## Week In Review

Overall, this was a pretty good week. I finally feel caught up at work and I'm starting to get caught up on my community commitments which makes me happier. I had the honor of being the [PyDev of the Week](http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2016/01/04/pydev-of-the-week-jeff-triplett/)!

I ate at home more (thank you [Lacey](https://twitter.com/laceynwilliams) and [Blue Apron](https://www.blueapron.com/)).
