## Week In Review

My week started off strong, but then between my weekend of helping work with the :horse:, trying out a new chair at work, and trying out a [BetterBack](http://getbetterback.com/) support, I ended up stressing my back out and causing myself to have back spasms. 

Luckily between two :pill:'s and a long Epsom :bath: soak and half a day of being knocked out by both, I felt almost normal again on Wednesday. Then I was behind a day at work and had to juggle all the things on Wednesday when my most important DCUS meetings were. Lacey took planning the organizer's meeting off my plate :muscle: which gave me more time to balance the rest. Teamwork at its finest! 

I liked the BetterBack support though, and in hindsight, it would have been a batter idea to start at 15 minutes or an hour a day and call it good.
