## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

I started the week strong by writing a PICO-8 pong game demo and then the rest of the week went quickly. I'm struggling to keep up with everything that's going on with clients atm, but I'm also juggling two new roles. 

I also dropped my rarely driven :car: off to get it looked at so I can switch my MO plates over to KS. I don't think they were impressed by what a challenge a car is. It'll be a few weeks apparently.

My "I'm not doing anything this weekend" attitude failed me and I ended up running into friends that I don't see often and going on a Snowman Shuffle Friday night and then attending my first ugly sweater party of the season. Thankfully, I had a nice do nothing Sunday and got to take the :dog: on a few long walks.
