## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

This weekend I joined a few dozen friends for our annual [Kanopolis State Park](http://ksoutdoors.com/State-Parks/Locations/Kanopolis) trip to watch our friends race in the [Rockin K Trail Run](http://www.ksultrarunners.org/rkinfo.html). This year the weather was terrible and it rained the entire time. It's normally a treat to see my friends at the half-way point, but they didn't allow anyone to drive out there this year because the roads were too muddy for most vehicles. Post-race everyone came over to our cabin and we had a taco bar with good food and drinks. The rain let up just long enough for us to have a campfire for an hour before the storm came back in.

On Sunday, my mother turned 70, and I spent more than half the day in a car either driving from Kanopolis State Park or to the airport and back. I get to see her in two weeks which will be nice.

The rest of my week can only be described as hell. I discovered that one of my google accounts stopped forwarding emails to my main account because the domain had expired for a few hours one day. So I have an inbox full of emails/questions during a very busy conference period that I did not even know I had received. The rest of my week was basically like that so I'll skip the negative.

More random stats:

- Extended my meh.com streak to 187 days in a row.
- Extended my no Amazon orders streak to 41 days.
