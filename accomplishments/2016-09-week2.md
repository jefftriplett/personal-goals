## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

I met and exceeded my weekly running goals this week including going for a Wednesday night hill run at Clinton where I clocked in 2.9 brutal hill miles.

I changed my vitamin routine back into something which helped me lose a bunch of weight a while back. I dropped nine pounds this week and gained back four pounds (still five down though). I am at a crossroads where I need to run more often and go back to more of a paleo diet / cheat day on Saturday to give myself a weekly goal to look forward to.

The rest of my week was pretty boring and mostly spend keeping up with clients. This weekend, I had family in town so I spent most of the weekend entertaining and making suggestions for things to do.
