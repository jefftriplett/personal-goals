## Additional Things I Did

## Week In Review

We celebrated Mother's Day and my partner's birthday this week. Today actually. It was also my son's first day back at daycare after two months of life at home with mom and dad. It took about three days for him to get adjusted and not tear up and scream during our morning drop-off. He did great.
