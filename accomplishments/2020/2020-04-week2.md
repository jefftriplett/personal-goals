## Week In Review

It was a three day weekend carried over from Easter. I was in between clients this week, but filled my time with OSS work, getting caught up with community work and taking a few days in between. 

Lately, I have wanted to write more. I find that writing is easier for me in the mornings, which is a bit of a challenge for me while I juggle my son until lunchtime every day while we are under our stay-at-home order. So I have lots of drafts and outlines, but at some point, I hope to have a bit more time to see them to completion.
