# Personal Goals

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

## Overarching Goals

1. :chart_with_upwards_trend: Spend money wisely and save :dollar:
1. :black_nib: Write more - One blog post per week. No cop-outs
1. :running: Run more often
