# Personal Goals

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

## Overarching Goals

1. :muscle: [Be healthy](goals/health.md) and :running: Run more often
1. :family: Family Time
1. :chart_with_upwards_trend: Spend money wisely and save :dollar:
1. :black_nib: Create more (writing, twitching, and maybe even a podcast)
1. :robot: Automate More, Do Less
